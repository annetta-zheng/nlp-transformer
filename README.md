## CS 5740: Natural Language Processing (Spring 2024)
This course constitutes an introduction to natural language processing (NLP), the goal of which is to enable computers to use human languages as input, output, or both. NLP is at the heart of many of todayâ€™s most exciting technological achievements, including machine translation, automatic conversational assistants and Internet search. The course will introduce core problems and methodologies in NLP, including machine learning, problem design, and evaluation methods.

## Project: Transformer

## Example commands

### Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g. conda, venv) for this assignment.

Example of virtual environment creation using conda:
```
conda create -n env_name python=3.10
conda activate env_name
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train and predict commands

Example commands (subject to change, just for inspiration):
```
python n_gram.py --n=3 --experiment_name=trigram --num_samples=100
python transformer.py --num_layers=4 --hidden_dim=256 --experiment_name=transformer
```

### Commands to run unittests

Ensure that your code passes the unittests before submitting it.
The commands can be run from the root directory of the project.
```
pytest tests/test_n_gram.py
pytest tests/test_transformer.py
```

### Submission

Ensure that the name of the submission files (in the `results/` subfolder) are:

- `subword_n_gram_test_wer_predictions.csv`
- `character_n_gram_test_wer_predictions.csv`
- `transformer_test_wer_predictions.csv`
